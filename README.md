## Project Description
This is the website for Girls Who Code at UMD! It contains information about the club, how to join, providing feedback, and more while also acting as a general resource for our community.

### Implementation details
The current site was built with pure HTML/CSS and some basic JS for animations. We used Figma to design the initial prototype. To keep headers and footers consistent across the pages, we import them in the HTML files for each page (Home/Index, About, Get Involved, Contact). Styling can be found in the styles.css file. We also designed the site to be simple and mobile-responsive.
